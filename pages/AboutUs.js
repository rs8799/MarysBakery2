						<p>My name is Mary. Two things I love baking and sweets. I began baking as a way to reduce the amount of processed ingredients I eat. This turned into me baking my own breads and muffins. Once i realized I'm actually pretty good (Family approval!) I said "Hey why don't I share my wonderfully delicously oh so healthy sweets with everyone". That is what you see here today. A family baking bussines with the principle of everyhing vegan and delicious! </p>
